# Set your Discord Status as your pc's Current CPU and RAM usage

This program uses the psutil library to get your CPU and RAM usage once every 10 seconds.
It then formats this to look nice and sends it as a request to discord.

It should look like this:




# setup


1. either run setup.bat or open a command prompt in the directory you have downloaded this to and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. edit the python file to have your discord token in

3. run main.pyw
